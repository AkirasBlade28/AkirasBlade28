- ✨🌱Being that 'logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world' thus resulting in its 'transcendental' form, as Ludwig Wittgenstein, pionir in philosophy of language and logic, claims it - it arrises to question: can a language that is based only and only on fundementals and principels of logic achive such leavel of greatness that by it's form and content is a pure  mirror image of the word? I belive, like most people do, that the answer lays in programing language. But, in order to know that for shure I decide to play the language game.
